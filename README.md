# CellEvolution
This project simulates cells in an enviorment in which they have to eat food to survive. Each cell is given a neural network which decides thier actions. Cells are created by choosing parents from the cells that are currently alive, with higher probability given to parents with higher fitness. The children are created by mixing the neural networks of both parents as well as mutations.
